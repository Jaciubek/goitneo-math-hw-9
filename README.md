Homework. Optimization problems

Hello, homework champion! Well, the finish line is soon ðŸ˜Š

You've already learned to invest in companies at the level of understanding probabilities. However, you want to grow and not only to evaluate probabilities but also to manage them independently. For this, you plan to use optimization theory ðŸ˜‰

Today you will independently:

- build a object function and a system of constraints
- solve a linear programming problem in Python using the scipy library
